## What Makes OKX Exchange Stand Out

OKX ranks as one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges, consistently placing in the top 3 on CoinMarketCap by trading volume and user base.

The platform's popularity among Korean traders comes from its comprehensive feature set and user-friendly interface. Whether you're interested in spot trading, futures, or options, OKX provides multiple investment pathways that work for both beginners and seasoned traders.

What really sets OKX apart is its Travel Rule integration with major Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Upbit. This means you can move funds in and out whenever you need to, without bureaucratic hassles or unnecessary delays.

## Creating Your OKX Account

Getting started on OKX is straightforward. Head to the official OKX website and click the "Sign Up" button. Select 'South Korea' as your country, check the agreement box, and hit 'Next'.

You'll need to provide an email address and create a secure password. After that, verify your phone number to complete the basic registration. Here's where it gets interestingâ€”when you use referral code **47044926** during signup, you unlock discounted trading fees that can save you money on every transaction.

Once you're in, you'll have access to all of OKX's features. The platform's third-place ranking on CoinMarketCap reflects its solid reputation and high liquidity, so you can trade with confidence.

## Completing KYC Verification

KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is your gateway to full platform access. Download the OKX app, log in, and tap the "Verify now" button on the main screen.

![KYC photo guide instructions](image/0778357602596.webp)

You'll be asked to choose your ID typeâ€”driver's license, passport, or national ID card. The app provides clear photo guidelines, so follow them closely. Make sure your document is fully visible, well-lit, and free from glare or blur.

Snap photos of the front and back of your ID, then take a selfie. That's it. Once OKX processes your verification, you're cleared to use all trading features and withdrawal functions. The whole thing usually takes just a few minutes.

## How to Deposit Funds

Moving crypto into OKX is simple. Open the app, tap "Assets," then select "Deposit."

![Selecting deposit crypto option](image/7179668363.webp)

You'll see two optionsâ€”choose "Deposit crypto." Type the name of the coin you want to deposit in the search bar. Let's say you're depositing XRP. After selecting it, you'll need to pick the network (Ripple for XRP).

![OKX deposit address and tag display](image/9159798873.webp)

The app generates a deposit address and tag, displayed as both a QR code and text string. Copy this information and paste it into your sending exchange's withdrawal form. Double-check everything before confirmingâ€”wrong addresses mean lost funds. Once you hit send, your deposit typically arrives within minutes, and you're ready to trade.

## Withdrawing from OKX

Withdrawals follow a similar pattern. From the main screen, tap "Assets," then "Withdraw."

![Selecting coin for withdrawal](image/3033903912.webp)

Pick the cryptocurrency you want to send out. If you're withdrawing USDT, for example, click "Address book" and select the Tron network (or whichever network your receiving wallet uses).

![Entering withdrawal details and amount](image/88204146025.webp)

Enter the destination address carefullyâ€”no typos allowed here. Input the amount you want to withdraw, review the details, and confirm. Since the process mirrors deposits, you'll get comfortable with it quickly. After confirmation, your funds typically reach their destination within minutes to an hour, depending on network congestion.
